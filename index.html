      <h2> &#160;&#160;About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutme"> The ever-changing landscape of technology further motivated me to pursue computer science as my primary field during high school.
        In high school, I secured exceptional academic grades with an impeccable centum in mathematics. This achievement paved the way for my admission to Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, affiliated to Anna University. The evolving mobile technology ignited the passion in me to choose Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) as my stream in undergraduate. The multi-faceted curriculum exposed me to diverse subjects such as digital signal processing and Computer architecture.
        As part of my academic journey, I had the opportunity to undergo In-plant Training at the Airport Authority of India, where I was trained on Instrument Landing System(ILS) and various types of antenna and radars. During that time, we identified lost baggage and damage to belongings as the most pressing issues in the Aviation sector. With a strong commitment to providing a better and more secure system for passengers, we proposed a foolproof design for a baggage tracing and handling system utilizing smart RFID tags and IOT based on a cloud server infrastructure. Our efforts were recognized when we were awarded the second prize AT SYNERGY 2K18, held at the VELLORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY(VIT) for presenting a paper regarding the same topic.
        As a committed engineer, I worked on the VLSI domain for my final year project focussing on the “Performance evaluation of low power and high-speed FFT processor”. This practice aimed to minimize the processing calculation delays while ensuring low power consumption. The main usage of this lies in FPGA to improve the processing speed of butterfly calculations and also basic arithmetic calculations. Through this project, I realized how my technological skills and problem-solving abilities have sharpened over the years.
        Apart from my technical competence, I actively engaged in organizational and leadership roles. As a member of FORSEE club in our college, I served as the Single Point Of Contact (SPOC) for liaising with HRs from various organizations to conduct recruitment drives and mock placement interviews for my fellow students. Additionally, I contributed to the organization of "Upagraha 2k17," a national-level technical symposium, and have mentored young and inspiring engineers in their fascinating mini-projects. These experiences honed my leadership, communication, and managerial skills. In the realm of sports, I represented my department’s

        cricket team during the inter-departmental cricket tournament held at my college. Additionally, I’ve also won the second prize in a District Level Chess Competition.
        Currently, I have been working as a software Engineer in “Intellect Design Arena” for almost
        3.5 years. In these couple of years, I got numerous opportunities to partake in different roles and to collaborate with diverse teams thereby helping me to bolster my technical skills. Initially, I set forth my journey as a Software Tester where I used my Python and Gherkin skills to build scripts for a top wealth management client in the UK that seamlessly runs on Salesforce, a well-known CRM application. In this capacity, I not only acquired a comprehensive knowledge of software testing methodologies but also developed a profound understanding of agile practices. During those years, I got to know the immense value Salesforce brings to businesses of all kinds, and also the wider opportunities it brings to shore up my career prospectus. Additionally, I expanded my horizons by mastering salesforce configurations and acquainted myself with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Apex programming languages. With the determination to innovate, I successfully developed a compelling proof of concept(POC). This accomplishment earned me the admiration of the development head, who recognized my exceptional efforts and promptly recommended me to the management for an upgraded role as a Salesforce Software Developer. Subsequently, my commitment and expertise were duly acknowledged, and I was bestowed with this prestigious position.
        Over 2 years down the line as a Software developer, I applied my proficiency in coding and admin skills to develop and resolve critical functionalities for my esteemed client. Moreover, my unwavering dedication and exceptional performance have been acknowledged through the reception of prestigious awards. The extensive work experiences across various roles were the main reason for my decision to pursue a Master’s program in Software Engineering Systems.
